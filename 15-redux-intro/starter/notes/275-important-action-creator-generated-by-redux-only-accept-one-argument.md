In AccountOperations.js, we have:
```
  function handleDeposit() {
    if (!depositAmount) return;

    dispatch(deposit(depositAmount, currency));
    setDepositAmount("");
    setCurrency("USD");
  }

```

When you use `deposit(depositAmount, currency)` in the context of Redux Toolkit's `createSlice`, the `(depositAmount, currency)` refers to the arguments you're passing to the action creator function. **However, by default, Redux Toolkit's action creators generated by `createSlice` only accept a single argument, which becomes the `payload` of the action. **

If you call the action creator with two arguments like `deposit(depositAmount, currency)`, only the first argument (`depositAmount`) will be used as the payload unless you have a custom logic inside the action creator.

### Understanding `(depositAmount, currency)`

In typical usage, when you define an action creator with `createSlice`, it expects a single argument:

- **If you pass one argument:** This argument becomes the `payload` of the action.
- **If you pass two or more arguments:** **Only the first argument is used as the `payload` unless you modify how the action creator works (e.g., using the `prepare` method).**

### How to Properly Handle Multiple Arguments

If you want to pass multiple pieces of data to the action, you should bundle them into a single object. For example:

```javascript
**dispatch(deposit({ amount: depositAmount, currency }));**
```

Hereâ€™s how this would work:

1. **Action Creator Call**:
   ```javascript
   const action = deposit({ amount: depositAmount, currency });
   ```
   
   This creates an action object like:
   ```javascript
   {
     type: 'account/deposit',
     payload: {
       amount: depositAmount,
       currency: currency
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Reducer Handling**:
   In your reducer, you would access `action.payload.amount` and `action.payload.currency` to get the values.

   ```javascript
   const accountSlice = createSlice({
     name: "account",
     initialState,
     reducers: {
       deposit(state, action) {
         state.balance += action.payload.amount;
         state.currency = action.payload.currency;
       },
     },
   });
   ```

### Custom Action Creators with `prepare`

If you really want to pass multiple arguments directly to the action creator, you would need to use the `prepare` function in `createSlice`:

```javascript
const accountSlice = createSlice({
  name: "account",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    deposit: {
      prepare(amount, currency) {
        return {
          payload: { amount, currency },
        };
      },
      reducer(state, action) {
        state.balance += action.payload.amount;
        state.currency = action.payload.currency;
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Now, with this setup, you can call:

```javascript
dispatch(deposit(depositAmount, currency));
```

### Summary

- **`deposit(depositAmount, currency)`**: Refers to the two arguments you're passing to the `deposit` action creator.
- **Default Behavior**: If `deposit` is generated by `createSlice`, only the first argument (`depositAmount`) would be used as the payload.
- **To Handle Multiple Arguments**: Bundle them into an object (`{ amount: depositAmount, currency }`) or use a `prepare` method to transform them into a single payload.
