The line of code `const partOfDay = time.slice(-2);` is used to extract the last two characters from the string time and assign them to the variable partOfDay

-2 as an Argument:
The -2 tells the slice() method to start the extraction two characters from the end of the string and continue to the end of the string.

For `time = "08:30AM":`

`time.slice(-2)` would extract the last two characters: "AM".
