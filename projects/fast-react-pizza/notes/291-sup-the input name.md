The value of `data.priority` comes from the `name` attribute of the input element, not the `id`. In HTML forms, when a form is submitted, the form data that gets sent to the server (or processed in your case) is organized based on the `name` attributes of the form fields.

### Detailed Explanation:

#### 1. **Name Attribute**:
   - The `name` attribute of a form input defines the key under which the value of that input will be stored when the form is submitted.
   - For example, in your checkbox input:
     ```html
     <input type="checkbox" name="priority" id="priority" />
     ```
     - The `name="priority"` means that when this checkbox is checked and the form is submitted, the value sent with the form data will be associated with the key `"priority"`.

#### 2. **Form Submission Process**:
   - When the form is submitted, the browser collects all the inputs with a `name` attribute and their values.
   - For checkboxes:
     - If the checkbox is **checked**, the browser sends the value `"on"` with the key corresponding to the `name` attribute (`priority` in this case).
     - If the checkbox is **not checked**, the browser does not include this input in the form data at all (which means `data.priority` will be `undefined`).

#### 3. **Role of `id` Attribute**:
   - The `id` attribute is used to uniquely identify an element in the HTML document. It is often used in conjunction with the `label` element to create a clickable label for the form control.
   - In your code:
     ```html
     <input type="checkbox" name="priority" id="priority" />
     <label htmlFor="priority">Want to give your order priority?</label>
     ```
     - The `id="priority"` is linked to the `<label>` using `htmlFor="priority"`, which allows users to click on the label to check/uncheck the checkbox. However, this `id` has no impact on the form submission process.

### Summary:
- **`name` Attribute**: Determines the key for the form data that is submitted. In your case, `data.priority` comes from the `name="priority"` attribute on the checkbox.
- **`id` Attribute**: Used for associating a label with an input and for uniquely identifying elements in the HTML. It does not affect the form data itself.
  
So, the `priority` property in your `order` object comes from the checkbox's `name` attribute, not the `id`.
