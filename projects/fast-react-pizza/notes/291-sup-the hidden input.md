An `<input>` element with `type="hidden"` is an HTML input element that is not visible to the user and does not provide any interface for interaction. However, it can still store data that is sent to the server when the form is submitted. This type of input is often used to store information that is necessary for form processing but doesn't need to be visible or modifiable by the user.

### Characteristics of `type="hidden"`:
- **Invisible to Users**: The input field does not appear on the page, so users cannot see or interact with it.
- **Holds Data**: It can store data such as IDs, tokens, or any other piece of information that needs to be passed along with the form submission.
- **Form Submission**: When the form is submitted, the value of the hidden input is included in the form data sent to the server.

### Example Usage:

```html
<form action="/submit-order" method="POST">
  <!-- Visible fields -->
  <input type="text" name="customerName" placeholder="Enter your name" />

  <!-- Hidden field -->
  <input type="hidden" name="orderId" value="12345" />

  <button type="submit">Submit Order</button>
</form>
```

### Common Use Cases:
1. **Storing IDs**: Hidden inputs are often used to store unique identifiers (like user IDs or product IDs) that need to be sent with the form submission but are not editable by the user.

2. **CSRF Tokens**: In web security, hidden inputs are commonly used to include CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tokens to ensure that form submissions are coming from authorized users.

3. **Preserving State**: If a form needs to preserve some data between page reloads or as part of a multi-step form process, hidden inputs can be used to store this data without showing it to the user.

### Example in Context:

If you have a web page where a user can update their profile, you might want to send the userâ€™s ID along with the form submission to know which user profile to update, but you don't want the user to see or modify the ID:

```html
<form action="/update-profile" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="username" value="JohnDoe" />
  <input type="hidden" name="userId" value="6789" />
  <button type="submit">Update Profile</button>
</form>
```

In this example, the `userId` is sent along with the form data but is not visible or editable on the page.
